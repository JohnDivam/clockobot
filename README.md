## Installation

Clockobot is built on top of Laravel, using the TALL stack. In order to install it, make sure you follow the following steps. If you struggle, make sure you refer to the extensive [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) before submitting a new issue.  

### Project requirements
- PHP 8.2.0 Required: latest Laravel requires PHP 8.2.0 or greater.
- curl 7.34.0: Laravel's HTTP client now requires curl 7.34.0 or greater.

### Noticeable composer dependencies
- [filament/notifications](https://filamentphp.com/docs/3.x/notifications/installation)
- [laravel/sanctum](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sanctum)
- [livewire/livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com/)
- [maatwebsite/excel](https://laravel-excel.com/)
- [wire-elements/modal](https://github.com/wire-elements/modal)

### Project setup

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/clockobot/clockobot.git`
2. Install composer dependencies: `composer install`
3. Install npm dependencies: `composer install`
4. Copy .env.example to .env and amend its values accordingly.
5. Run `php artisan migrate` or if you want some dummy data run `php artisan migrate --seed`
6. Run `php artisan storage:link`
7. Run the app using `php artisan serve` or any other tool (we use [Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/))

### Mail setup

Before adding any user, you need to make sure you have amended these variables in your .env file.

```
MAIL_MAILER=
MAIL_HOST=
MAIL_PORT=
MAIL_USERNAME=
MAIL_PASSWORD=
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

Feel free to use the setup you like when using Laravel apps: https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/mail

### First connexion

Open the site and register a new user. You will directly be redirected to the dashboard.

__When using dummy data:__

If you seeded dummy data during installation, you can login using the following credentials:

User: `clockobot@clockobot.com` | Password: `password`

Once you're connected to the admin, create a new user using your email and **make sure to assign admin rights to it** . It will send you a link to reset your password. Once you've done so, login by using your newly created user. Feel free to then delete the default user created during installation. Note that deleting a user deletes all its data as well, so all the dummy data will be gone.

### Disable registration
User registration hasn't been removed by default but as the app allows you to add users, you might want to disable registration depending on how you want it to be setup.
In order to do so, please follow these steps:

Comment/delete these lines in `routes/auth.php`:

```
Route::get('register', [RegisteredUserController::class, 'create'])
    ->name('register');

Route::post('register', [RegisteredUserController::class, 'store']);
```

### Api Ready (WIP)

While it isn't documented yet, Clockobot comes bundled with some endpoints that allow you to interact with its data from an external tool. As we have projects going this way for Clockobot, this part might evolve along the way. Meanwhile, you can check the `app/Http/Controllers/Api` directory and the `routes/api.php` file to see what endpoints are made available to you.
